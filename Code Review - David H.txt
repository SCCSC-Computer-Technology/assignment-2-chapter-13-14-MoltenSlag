[] The code compiles with no warnings and the data grid populates on startup.
[] The code is well documented with lengthy comments.
It was easy to understand what the methods do, even for things I haven't tried before, like controlling the keypress events.
Buttons and labels are named well. Name properties for controls are good.
[] I like that controlling what inputs are accepted in the fields eliminates the need for ex. handling in some cases.
I feel like setting the moreThanNum to zero if parse fails is good for program stability, but could appear like unintended program behavior from the User's POV. Not serious issue though.
[] The only real issue I found is the Min/Max section not allowing a range to query.
I would just put a single radio button for that entire section and allow both fields to accept input and have one button run the method/parsing, so you can keep the input handling the same.
[] The pros to your approach are that you don't have to bug the user with a dialog box when they try to enter wrong input. The user will learn more intuitively what inputs are acceptable.
Also clearing the text fields when switching between radio buttons ensures the user won't expect a different outcome.
[] I like the idea of exerting more control over the text fields and will try to see how I can implement something similar in later programs.
[] I almost think that leaving already entered text in a field can be better than removing it as the user can quickly switch between searches and the grid will adjust its output.
