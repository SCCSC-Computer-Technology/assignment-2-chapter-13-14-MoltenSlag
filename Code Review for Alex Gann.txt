I love the design of your form it is very clean and you understand what to do right away. As I was testing your code I could not find any flaws and was not even able to produce an error. 

After reviewing your code I can see you have some really good documentation explaining things clearly and what the. I like how you made it so users are unable to type incorrect data types depending on what search box they use. using e.Handled for that is a nice use and I need to do more research into it. Over all your code is good.
