I could not compile the code because an exception occured due to a mismatch between the versions of SQL on our ends, so I simply reviewed the code instead. I like how the form is organized between item search, quantity search, and price search. I also like the QOL additions and the input validation for each textbox.

One way our code was different is that you allowed the user to select one criteria to search for at a time: for example, if the user wants to search for product number, the user can't search for description. I prefer your implementation in this case, but I think that both of our implementations have value. For example, I allowed the user to search for a minimum price and maximum price at the same time, which I prefer over your implmentation.
