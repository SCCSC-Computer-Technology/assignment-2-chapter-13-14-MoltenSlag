I was unable to run the code due to issues with SQL on my end. So sadly I was unable to test the program itself. That said, I do like the way you have the front end laid out. The groups and radio buttons are a very good solution for allowing this program to handle multiple functions without being confusing. Radio buttons help reduce the number of “search” buttons you need. It hadn’t even crossed my mind to do that and I think it would have helped to declutter my own assignment.I did include a “reset” button that might be nice to help bring the program back to a “clean slate” without the need to close and reopen or trick it by putting like “Price More Than 0” and searching.

For the TtyParse statements I set those up to be the if statement itself, to avoid needing to set a bool. However; I could see there being additional advantages to using the bool, especially if you end up needing it later in the code. Like if you wanted to write more complex ‘if and ‘else if’ statements that might go into further detail about the nature of the error and how the user might fix it. I would personally avoid setting the user input values and running the query in the event of a user input error. I really liked the input handlers to make sure only valid input was being put in, I’m disappointed that I’m currently unable to test if they worked.

I would suggest including error messages to help explain why user input is invalid and steps they can take to correct or at least what the program is looking for. This can help to reduce user frustration and there’s always a chance that the users might see or relay data like the product numbers to each other in a different format. The database might be looking for 10-01 but the folks using the system might forgo the ‘-’ when communicating with each other and simply enter 1001 or 10 01. Being specific about why there is an error and what the program is expecting can help reduce “bug reports” that simply amount to user error.

I also really like the radio button if/else statements you have to highlight the expected location for the input and the focus shift. I do wonder how this behaves while tabbing around the page, but I would assume it works just fine. I think it was a really good idea to make input text boxes that don’t need to be filled in “read only.” I might suggest including a message or “N/A” in the read only text box to (once again) coddle the users. I do believe that in practice a grayed out text box should be easily understood by all users and should be enough of a clue that the field does not need to have data entered for the search to function.
